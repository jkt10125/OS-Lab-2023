readme


mergesort.cpp contains all the necessary functions along with the mergesort and bubblesort code.
this file is tested and working correctly.
(altough taking too much time to sort the array - because of sequential accessing of list elements)

all left is to modularize the file.
in order to avoid any confusion i have erased the goodmalloc file.
